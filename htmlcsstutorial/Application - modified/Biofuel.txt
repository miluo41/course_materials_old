The prepondance of scientific evidence accumulated over the past few decades has pointed to the use of fossil fuels as one major cause for global climate change. Though the forward trajectory of ongoing climate change is less than certain, the potential envionmental consequences associated with it are simply too grave to ignore. Gradually phasing out the use of fossil fuels and substituting with carbon-neutral renewable energies is the environmentally responsible path for human society to move forward. Compared with other renewable energy forms, liquid biofuels are more compatible with current infrastructure and have a much higher energy density. My current work aims at deriving biofuels from waste plant biomass in stead of the traditional choice of glucose, if successfully implemented and commercially viable, this approach avoids competition with food production for the limited agricultural land.
