Compared to actively growthing cells, bacterial endospores and biofilms can generally survive much harsher treatments from small molecule antimicrobial agents. This phenomena has largely been attributed to their more dormant metabolic state. As side projects during my PhD study (and also out of my personal interest), I explored several new approaches aginst these two resilient life forms.
