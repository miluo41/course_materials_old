Biomaterials generally refer to materials designed to function in biological systems. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) has been the gold standard in this area of bioengineering research for decades. Despite the robustness and popularity of PEG, the general lack of structural diversity of PEG makes it difficult to tailor and fine-tune this polymer for specific biomedical scenarios. This limitation has motivated many researchers to search for possible alternatives, and zwitterionic polymers have emerged in recent years as a promising candidate. My Ph.D. works on zwitterionic materials demonstrated, without compromising its biocompatibility and nonfouling property, the scope of molecular designs feasible on this group of polymers.
