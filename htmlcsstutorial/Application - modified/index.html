			<h2>About</h2>
			<br>
			<p class="first_p">Luo Mi is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at UCLA working in Professor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_C._Liao" target="blank">James C. Liao</a> group. His current research projects focus on renewable energy production using synthetic biology approaches, as well as applying predicative models to explore new routes in metabolic screening. Prior to his relocation to California in June 2014, Luo was a pround member of University of Washington (Seattle) ChemE Department for six years under the guidance of Professor <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/jgroup/members.html" target='blank'>Shaoyi Jiang</a>. Luo received top departmental honor (2013) for his PhD research on design and synthesis of biomaterials/antimicrobial agents aided by quantum chemistry calculation and molecular dynamic simulation.</p>

			<p>Luo is an avid learner in data science and everything statistics, which is his own way of being an arm-chair detective and internet sleuth.</p>
			<p>He is fluent in Data Analysis with <strong>R</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/miluo41/ML_aided_screening">sample code</a>), and <strong>python</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/miluo41/rna_seq_clostridium">sample code</a>), also with working knowledge in <strong>HTML5</strong> and <strong>CSS3</strong> (used in building this website).</p>
			<br>
			<p>Outside Luo's academic endeavors, his favourite things in life include: playing squash with friends; watching movies with his wife; and reading Jeanette Winterson novels on a Seattle rainy day afternoon while having TV-series Frasier playing in the background.</p>
